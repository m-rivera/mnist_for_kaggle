# mnist_for_kaggle
Neural network example for the Kaggle 'Digit Recognizer' challenge.

This is intended as a beginner project for neural networks and Tensorflow. The data sets are MNIST samples from the Kaggle challenge, [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

There is one hidden layer of 64 neurons, the optimization is carried out with Adam, the loss function is the sparse categorical entropy, and 10 epochs are used.

The accuracy score for the test data is 0.969.
